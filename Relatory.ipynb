Kliment](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Linda-K-Kliment-2009566973), we can conclude that most strikes happen next to the landing stages, while it's uncommon for strikes to happen when the plane is on the ground.\n",

We take $1000$ samples of the size of our dataframe ($163956$ rows) from the data with reposition and compute an approximation to the confidence interval from the population. The statistic considered is the number of strikes that occur in the Autumn and the Summer in comparison with the total number of strikes in the sample.\n",
